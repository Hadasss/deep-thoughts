  // we added a "proxy" key-value pair to the package.json in the client folder. With this proxy value in place, the Create React App team set up the development server to prefix all HTTP requests using relative paths with whatever value is provided to it. Now the HTTP requests will work in both development and production environments!
});

// create a middleware function that will retrieve the user token and combine it with the existing httpLink
// FYI In this case, we don't need the first parameter offered by setContext(), which stores the current request object, but we still need to access the second one, we can use an underscore _ to serve as a placeholder for the first parameter.

// FYI Notice how we have to use an absolute path to the server? The React environment runs at localhost:3000, and the server environment runs at localhost:3001. So if we just used /graphql, as we've done previously, the requests would go to localhost:3000/graphqlâ€”which isn't the address for the back-end server.
